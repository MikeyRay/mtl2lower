# mtl2lower
Plugin to lowercase all your materials with a single button.

# How to install
1. Download the source
2. Go to your scripts folder (Documents/Maya/<your_version>/scripts)
3. Open your **userSetup.mel** (create one if you don't have it!) and add the following line: `python("import mtl2lower");`
4. That's it! You might have to restart Maya if it's open to ensure it's there.

# Disclaimer
This tool was made purely for myself and to make my life easier porting assets. There's likely better methods (in Maya), but this one works perfectly for me. If there's any issues with the tool, feel free to let me know!
